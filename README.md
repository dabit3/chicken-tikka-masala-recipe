This is one of my favorite dishes, and a lot of people who eat this tell me it's one of their favorite meals as well. They often ask for the recipe, so I decided to open source it. This will probably evolve over time as I improve and experiment with it. Enjoy!

- 1 teaspoon ginger finely grated

## Instructions

### The chicken

- Put the chicken in a bowl with all of the ingredients of the chicken marinade, stir everything together well and let it sit for 10 minutes to a few hours

- In a frying pan, add butter and saute the chicken until it is fully cooked and browned on each side. Set to the side until later.

### The gravy

- In a large and tall cooking pot, melt the butter and fry the onions until soft while stirring occasionally.

- Add ginger and garlic for just about 30 seconds while continuing to stir. Then add chicken tikka masala seasoning, pepper, and salt.

- Add in tomatoes and tomato sauce. Let this simmer until the tomatoes start to break down.

- Once the tomatoes are breaking down, use a masher to crush the tomatoes and onions into a paste / sauce with no large pieces left

- Add the heavy cream and the brown sugar, stir everything in. Finally, add the chicken and let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes. From here, check the consistency and decide to your taste to add more cream or water.
